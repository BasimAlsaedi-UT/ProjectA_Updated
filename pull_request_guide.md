# Pull Request Review Process

## 1. Access the Pull Request
- Go to the [ProjectA repository](https://github.com/balsaedi/ProjectA).
- Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab.

## 2. Select the Target Branch
- Ensure that the pull request is targeting the `code_challenge` branch.
- Check the title and description of the pull request for a clear understanding of the changes.

## 3. Review Files
- Click on the "Files changed" tab to see the student's answers in the R Script being submitted in the pull request.
- Examine the changes in each file to ensure they align with code challenge requirements and code challenge answers. You can copy the file locally and copy the code challenge test to initially check if expected output is produced before reviewing the files. A GitHub action can alternatively be set up for this.

## 4. Check for Code Challenge Answers
- Carefully review the pull request's R script
- Verify that the answers are correct, efficient, and overall match the code challenge answers.

## 5. Add Comments for Improvements
- If you find issues or areas for improvement, add comments directly in the code using GitHub's comment feature.
- Be constructive and provide clear explanations for suggested changes and you can ask the student to resubmit a new pull request, but remember to close the unsuccessful one.

## 6. Decide on Mergeability
- Consider the overall quality of the changes and whether they meet the project's standards.
- If everything looks good, the pull request can be deemed mergeable and you can merge the student's pull request into the code_challenge branch.

## 7. Approve the Pull Request
- If the changes are satisfactory, and you believe the code challenge answers are correct, approve the pull request.
- Leave a comment expressing your approval.

## 8. Close the Pull Request (if needed)
- If there are significant issues or the code challenge answers are incorrect, communicate the reasons in the comments.
- Request the author to make necessary corrections.
- Once the issues are addressed, the pull request can be re-evaluated and merged.
