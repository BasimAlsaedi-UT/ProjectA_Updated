# CODE CHALLENGE 6

#  1. Using `table()` create a contingency table named
#  `penguins_contingency_table`  using the species and island columns from the
#  penguins dataset.
#
#  2. Create a contingency table with `xtabs()` and assign to the variable
#  `penguins_xtabs_table` using the species and island columns with a formula
#  from the Palmer Penguins dataset.
#
#  3. Calculate the proportions of penguin species for each island using the
#  contingency table created in Challenge 1. Assign the resulting proportions
#  to a variable named `penguins_species_proportions`
#
#  4. Conduct an independent two-sample t-test to compare the miles per gallon, of
#  cars with 4 cylinders (cyl == 4) and cars with 6 cylinders (cyl == 6) in the
#  mtcars dataset. Assign the p-value of the test to a variable named
#  `t_test_mpg_vs_cyl_pvalue`
#
#  5. Using the penguins dataset, calculate the z-scores for the body mass of
#  Chinstrap penguins. Calculate the z-scores relative to the entire dataset
#  and assign the resulting vector to a variable named `z_scores_body_mass`
#
#  6. Calculate the z-scores for the flipper length (flipper_length_mm) of Adelie
#  penguins in the penguins dataset. Calculate the z-scores relative to the
#  entire dataset and assign the resulting vector to a variable named
#  `z_scores_flipper_length`
#
#  7. Use the mtcars dataset. Create a variable named `transmission_table` that
#  contains the frequency table of the different transmission types (am column)
#
#  8. Using the iris dataset, create a variable named `iris_species_table` that
#  contains the frequency table of the different species of iris flowers
#
#  9. Use the penguins dataset. Create a cross-tabulation using xtabs() to display
#  the counts of penguin species (species) based on their island location.
#  Assign the resulting cross-tabulation to a variable named `penguin_cross_tab`
#
#  10. Using the electronics data dataset, tabulate how many electronics fell
#  under which discount category and assign it to `discount_types`
