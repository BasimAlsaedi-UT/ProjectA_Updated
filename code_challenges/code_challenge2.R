# CODE CHALLENGE 2

#  1. Using the used car price dataset, find the highest and lowest seats in our
#  dataset and assign highest to `max_seats` and `min_seats`.
#
#  2. Return the variance and standard deviation of mileage in our dataset. Assign
#  your results to `mileage_var` and `mileage_sd` respectively.
#
#  3. Check for skewness for mileage in our dataset and
#  - if the data is positively skewed, assign "positively skewed" to the
#  variable `is_skewed`
#  - if the data is positively skewed, assign "negatively skewed" to the
#  variable `is_skewed`
#  - if it is symmetric, assign "symmetric" to the variable `is_skewed`
#
#  4. Check for correlation between number of seats and mileage
#  - if positively correlated, assign "correlated" to `is_correlated`
#  - if negatively correlated, assign "not correlated" to `is_correlated`
#
#  5. Using the avocado dataset in the datasets folder, check for skewness in
#  average avocado prices.
#  - if the data is positively skewed, assign "positively skewed" to the
#  variable `is_skewed`
#  - if the data is positively skewed, assign "negatively skewed" to the
#  variable `is_skewed`
#  - if it is symmetric, assign "symmetric" to the variable `is_skewed`
#
#  6. Find the range of total volume of all avocados and assign to `volume_range`.
#
#  7. Report on the standard deviation and variance of the total bags column.
#  For standard deviation assign your result to `tot_bags_sd` and for variance,
#  assign it to `tot_bags_sd`
#
#  8. Find the IQR, median and mean of extra large bags of avocados, assigning
#  your results to `xl_bags_iqr`, `xl_bags_median` and `xl_bags_avg`
#
#  9. Using the starbucks dataset, return the average calories of beverages that
#  were Caff√® Latte and assign your result to `latte_avg`
#
#  10. For all Classic Espresso Drinks in the beverage category, find the standard
#  deviation of total fat they contained and assign to `total_fat_sd`.
