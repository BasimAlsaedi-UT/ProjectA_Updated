#  CODE CHALLENGE 4

#  1. Create a function called `check_even_odd` that takes in a given positive
#  integer and checks if it is an even or odd number.
#
#  2. Create a function named `is_prime` that checks if a given positive integer
#  is a prime number. The function should return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE)
#
#  3. Given a triangle with a base and a height, create a function called
#  `calculate_triangle_area` that calculates the area of said triangle
#
#  4. Create a function called find_maximum that takes in two numbers as arguments
#  and returns the larger of the two.
#
#  5. Create a function named `calculate_average` that takes a numeric vector as
#  an argument and returns the average (mean) of the values.
#
#  6. Develop a function named `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a
#  palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that
#  reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and
#  capitalization. Use `tolower()` to convert any input to lower cases inside
#  your function code before you do anything else.
#
#  7. Create a function named `calculate_factorial` that takes a positive integer
#  as an argument and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a
#  non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or
#  equal to n. Read more about factorial [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
#
#  8. Create a function called `is_positive` that takes a numeric value as an
#  argument and returns TRUE if the number is positive, and FALSE otherwise.
#
#  9. Implement a function named `is_leap_year` that takes a year (as a positive
#      integer) as an argument and returns TRUE if it's a leap year and FALSE
#     otherwise. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it
#     is also divisible by 400.
#
#  10. Create a function named `reverse_vector` that takes a vector as an argument
#     and returns a new vector with the elements reversed. The function should not
#     modify the original vector, only reverse the order of elements.
