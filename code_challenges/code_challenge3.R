# CODE CHALLENGE 3

#  You are to use base R and ggplot2 for each question below. For the next 5
#  questions, using the CO2 dataset from the `datasets` package:
#    1. Visualize the distribution of concentration levels and assign the base R
#  visualization to `base_viz1` and ggplot one to `gg_plot1`
#
#  2. Visualize the distribution of uptake by type using a boxplot and assign the
#  base R visualization to `base_boxplot` and ggplot one to `gg_boxplot`
#
#  3. For each plant, visualize the concentration levels using a barplot. Assign
#  the base R viz to `base_bar` and ggplot to `gg_bar` respectively
#
#  4. Create a scatterplot to show the relationship between concentration and
#  uptake levels and assign the base R and ggplot scatterplots to
#  `base_scatterplot` and `gg_scatterplot` respectively
#
#  5. Visualize the distribution of sepal length in base R and petal width with
#  ggplot2 using the iris dataset and assign the base R visualization to
#  `base_viz2` and ggplot one to `gg_plot2`
#
#  6. Visualize the distribution of petal lengths by species using a boxplot using
#  the iris dataset and assign the base R visualization to `base_iris_boxplot`
#  and ggplot one to `gg_iris_boxplot`
#
#  7. Visualize the distribution of car weights by the number of cylinders using
#  the mtcars dataset and assign the base R visualization to
#  `base_viz3` and ggplot one to `gg_plot3`
#
#  8. Create a scatterplot to show the relationship between car weight and miles
#  per gallon and assign the base R and ggplot scatterplots to
#  `base_car_scatterplot` and `gg_car_scatterplot` respectively
#
#  9. Using the airquality dataset, visualize the wind speed for each day using a
#  barplot. Assign the base R viz to `base_wind_bar` and ggplot to
#  `gg_wind_bar` respectively
#
#  10. Visualize the distribution of sepal widths by species using the iris
#  dataset and assign the base R visualization to `base_iris_viz` and ggplot
#  one to `gg_iris_plot`
