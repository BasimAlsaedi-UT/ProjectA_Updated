# CODE CHALLENGE 7
#
#  Perform a linear regression analysis on the `mtcars` dataset to identify
#  statistically significant variables influencing the prediction of a car's miles
#  per gallon. These are the following tasks to be undertaken:
#
#  1. Assign the resulting linear regression model object to a
#     variable named `linear_model`.
#
#  2. Extract and assign the confidence interval for
#     the regression model to a variable named `confidence_interval`
#
#  3. Generate a summary of the linear regression model, including relevant
#     statistics, and assign it to a variable named `model_summary`.
#
#  4. Finally, use the `linear_model`
#     to make predictions for the miles per gallon values in the mtcars dataset,
#     and assign the predicted values to a variable named `predicted_mpg`
