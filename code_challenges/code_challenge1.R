# CODE CHALLENGE 1

# 1. Create two numeric vectors, `vec1` and `vec2`, with at least 5 elements each.
# Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# between `vec1` and `vec2.` Store the results in new vectors: `addition_vec`,
# `subtraction_vec`, `multiplication_vec` and `division_vec`.

# 2. You have 6 coworkers: Jim, Pam, Michael, Oscar, Dwight and Stanley. Create a
# vector called `office_buddies` and store your coworkers' names there. After,
#   you create the vector, extract Michael's name using bracket notation and
# assign it to a variable named `regional_manager`


# 3. Generate a vector named `score` containing the following scores of students
# in a test: 15, 25, 8, 39, 4, 45, 33, 31, 49, and 21. These scores were
# initially marked out of 50.
# - Calculate the percentage score for each student by
# performing the relevant vector operations on it and store the result to a new
# vector name `score_pct`
# - Subset `score_pct` to return scores over 60%.

# 4. Using the USArrests dataset, subset for all data where UrbanPop was greater
#than or equal to 80. Assign the resulting dataframe to `high_pop`

# 5. Create a 4x4 matrix, `myMatrix` with numbers from 1 to 16 and then, extract
# all elements in the second row and assign to `second_row`

# 6. Create a list called `my_list` containing elements: apple, mango, 56.9,
#TRUE, tropical, 35 and FALSE.
#- Retrieve the last element in the list
#- Add a new element to your list called Jamaica
#- Remove the fourth element in the list.
#- Return the length of your list

# 7. Using the trees dataset, subset for all rows and columns for trees with a
#girth greater than 15. Assign the new dataframe to `girth_15`

# 8. Create a list called `real_madrid` with elements representing the club's
#   stadium: Santiago Bernab√©u, the city: Madrid, the year it was founded: 1902
#   and the league: La Liga. Also add the a logical value true or false,
#   indicating if you like Real Madrid and assign that to `is_liked`

# 9. Using the jobs_in_data.csv file as your dataframe:
#    - Import the dataframe and assign to a variable called `df`
#    - Subset the first 5 rows of all columns in your dataframe and assign to
#      `first_five`
#    - Filter the dataset to return all rows and all columns where the job title
#      is a Data Analyst and assign to `data_analysts_df`
#    - Return the average salary for all data analysts and assign to
#      `avg_salary`

# 10. Create a numeric vector, `numbers`, with values from 1 to 20.
#    - Calculate the mean of the vector and assign to `avg_num`
#    - Square each element of the vector and assign to `squared_num`
#    - Find the maximum value in the modified vector and assign to `highest_val`
